Data Professional Survey Analysis-
Iâ€™m excited to share my latest Power BI project, where I analyzed survey data from data professionals to uncover key insights and trends. Here's a snapshot of what I've achieved:
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Ensured accuracy by removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and standardizing entries. 
2. Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards with slicers, charts, and drill-throughs for dynamic exploration.
3. Data Analysis: Analyzed job satisfaction, tools used, and salary distribution across demographics and roles.
4. Advanced DAX Calculations: Developed complex measures and KPIs for deeper insights.
5. Interactive Reports: Designed reports for user-driven data exploration.
